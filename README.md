# Vocabster

Vocabster is an English vocabulary learning application designed for kindergarten children, aiming to provide a fun experience that encourages them in the learning process.

## Features
### Today's Menu 📖
You can create your own icons here. Remember to feed Vocabster with the icons you've created.

`Canvas`🖌️
- Make good use of the _pencil_ and _eraser_ to draw your icons. You can redraw the entire icon using the _Reset button_ or click the _Done button_ when you are satisfied with your drawing. Just a reminder: if you click the _Close button_, all your drawings will be lost without any means of restoration. 

### Magnifier 🔎
A tool for exploring _Vocabster's stomach_. By pressing the Magnifier button once, you will receive a magnifier. Try moving it and clicking on Vocabster.

### Vocabster's Stomach🫃
All icons fed to Vocabster will be stored here according to their categories.

`Edit your Icons` 🦾

- By pressing the _Edit button_, you can revise or even redraw your icons to make them more satisfying to you.

### Lifes ❤️
Feed Vocabster to restore its lives; don't let it go hungry!

### EXP system 🤴
Feeding Vocabster with icons makes it stronger and stronger, but more icons are needed for it to grow. Each time it levels up, it undergoes a slight change. Try to reach the maximum level and discover all its transformations!

EXP contained in each icon: 100

___Required EXP to level up for each Level:___ 
- Level 1: 500
- Level 2: 1000
- Level 3: 2500
